# Hex Sticker Templates

Create perfectly aligned hexagonal stickers for your projects! These templates ensure consistent sizing and spacing, allowing your stickers to fit together seamlessly.

## Why Use a Template?

**Important:** The standard aspect ratio of hex-stickers is **not 1:1**!  
Instead, the correct dimensions are **5.08 cm x 4.39 cm**.  
Starting from a proper template guarantees that your stickers will align neatly side-by-side without any awkward gaps.
